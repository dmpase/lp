Final Exam
August 10, 1998

1.  Write a Java program that creates two threads, 0 and 1, and 
    exits.  Each thread runs for 50 iterations.  Each iteration
    prints its thread number then sleeps for 1000 milliseconds.

2.  Create two classes, Address and SonOfAddress.  Address stores
    a person's name, address and telephone number.  SonOfAddress
    inherits from Address and adds a social security number.

3.  Create a new class, WierdException, that stores a character
    string and an integer value.  The string is returned as the
    value of toString().  Write an additional function, throwWE,
    that throws the exception WierdException for any reason you
    choose.  Write a third function that calls throwWE and catches
    the exception.

4.  For Java variables, list the access modifiers and persistence
    or storage class attributes.

5.  Describe how the equivalent of C++ virtual functions are
    provided in Java.
